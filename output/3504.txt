This artwork showcases a captivating play of light and radial patterns, creating a dynamic and almost hypnotic effect. The image predominantly features concentric arcs radiating from a central point, with a bright white light that gradually shifts to softer pink and purple hues as it extends outward. The gradient adds depth, while the lines suggest movement and energy, as if emanating waves.

The use of light and color creates a sense of expansion and draws the viewerâ€™s eye towards the center. This dynamic use of elements, combined with the symmetry of the arcs, gives the piece an ethereal and almost cosmic feel.

The art successfully evokes a sense of vastness and infinity, similar to phenomena observed in nature, like solar flares or galactic cores. The interplay of light and shadow adds to this sensation, enhancing the abstract quality of the piece.

For a similar existing artwork, "Movement in Squares" by Bridget Riley shares a comparable focus on optical effects and pattern dynamics. Although Riley's work mainly uses black and white, both pieces create a sense of movement and depth through repetition and patterning.
